### 👨🏽‍🦱 Lets Start With An Awesome Introduction

Hi 👋, I'm Aayush Parmar (aka Owner of White-Vulpes), where coding 🖥️ is my canvas. I'm currently crafting a cutting-edge Home Automation System with OpenThread technology with @chirag-parmar. A proud graduate of SRM University, Kattankulathur, I'm always ready for new challenges. Looking for a tech wizard? I'm open for hire and available for freelancing projects. Just hit me up on one of my contacts!

### 💼 Professional Adventures

**Subspace Technologies** was my playground 🛠️ from November 2023 to July 2024, where I thrived as a Software Engineer Intern. I had the opportunity to develop an advanced in-browser code editor with Vue.js and Node.js, create Python scripts to keep mobile plans data real-time 📱, integrate PPI APIs for smooth payment processes 💳, and build APIs using Node.js and FastAPI.

As a **Freelance Full Stack Developer** from May 2023 to November 2023, I had the freedom 🦅 to explore various projects. I built a jewellery website 💍 using Hasura GraphQL and Azure, developed a web application to display event locations with statistical analysis 📊, created a photography website from scratch with React and CloudFront 📸, and even automated WhatsApp message links using Excel macros 📲.

### 🛠️ Skills That I Wield

**Frontend Technologies** - React, Vue.js, Flutter, Android Studio, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere

**Backend Technologies** - Spring Boot, C/C++, Django, FastAPI, Express.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Redis

**Databases** - Hasura GraphQL Engine, PostgreSQL, MySQL

**Cloud Services** - Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud

### 🌟 Some Cool Side-Quests

At SRM University, I led the development of the cultural events website as a Full Stack Developer. Designing with Figma, I ensured a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, led the front-end team 🏅, and managed a secure ticketing system 🎫. These experiences honed my leadership skills and allowed me to blend creativity with technical expertise.
